Behance Website Clone for Presidio

## Introduction 
This project aims to replicate the [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) website, focusing primarily on frontend development to showcase my skills in this area. Developed using Next.js, it serves as a precursor to a planned full-stack implementation.

## Installation
Ensure you have Node.js installed, preferably version 14.0.3 or higher. If not, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) Once you have the proper Node.js version, clone this repository and execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm install
```
This command installs all required dependencies. To start the server, use:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will initiate the server at localhost:3000.
